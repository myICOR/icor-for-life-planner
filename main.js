/* ICOR for Life - Planner - the myPKA Cockpit weekly planner, replicated inside Obsidian.
 *
 * Hand-written CommonJS, no build step. Architecture mirrors the
 * cockpit expansion (REFINE/Expansions/mypka-cockpit) with one structural
 * difference: plan state lives in MARKDOWN FRONTMATTER inside the vault
 * ("02 Planner/"), not in a SQLite sidecar. Every synced task is a note, so
 * the AI team can read and move items by editing frontmatter, and the board
 * re-renders live off metadataCache events.
 *
 * Connector posture (inherited from the cockpit contract, connectors/types.js):
 *   - each connector resolves its own secret from plugin settings and emits a
 *     flat, normalized, SECRET-FREE shape; the board never special-cases a source
 *   - connectors NEVER throw upward: every failure degrades to a calm
 *     { ok:false, reason } and the UI renders a quiet notice, never a crash
 *   - calendar is ALWAYS read-only; task sources are read-only in v1
 *     (completing a card is a local strike-through, never a source write)
 *   - calendar events never become per-event notes, but since 0.5.0 the
 *     parsed defs mirror into ONE cache file ("02 Planner/Calendar Events.md")
 *     so the board renders instantly on relaunch (pale + pulsing until the
 *     fresh fetch lands) and the AI team can read the schedule from the vault.
 *     The cache is SECRET-FREE by contract: event data only, never the ICS
 *     feed URL or its private key.
 *   - reconcile semantics: a task absent from a source's FULL open set on a
 *     healthy fetch is genuinely done -> status: done. On a failed fetch the
 *     files stay untouched (never prune on a blip), and since 0.13.0 a
 *     healthy fetch that read only PART of the open set (a page walk stopped
 *     at its cap, a mailbox with more stars than the read takes, a filter
 *     narrowed since the last sync) carries complete:false and reconciles
 *     nothing either: the upserts still run, so the board stays live, but
 *     absence from a window is never read as a completion.

/* ========================================================================== *
 * Secret vault (0.9.0) - where the credentials live.
 *
 * API facts, verified against obsidian.d.ts (obsidian-api, master, fetched
 * 2026-09-06), not recalled from memory:
 *   - `app.secretStorage: SecretStorage`, tagged @since 1.11.4. The class
 *     extends Events and declares exactly three methods, all SYNCHRONOUS:
 *       setSecret(id: string, secret: string): void   (throws on a bad id)
 *       getSecret(id: string): string | null
 *       listSecrets(): string[]
 *     There is NO delete method in the typings. An entry is cleared by
 *     writing the empty string; this layer treats '' and null alike.
 *   - The id rule, from the setSecret doc: "Lowercase alphanumeric ID with
 *     optional dashes". A colon is not allowed, so keys are prefixed with
 *     `icor-for-life-planner-` (dash), never `icor-for-life-planner:`.
 *   - The namespace is GLOBAL, not per plugin: listSecrets() returns every
 *     id in the store, and the SettingSecretControl added in 1.13.2 persists
 *     a key reference any plugin could name. Hence the prefix on every key,
 *     and `secretKey` sanitising whatever it is handed into that alphabet.
 *   - Where the data goes, per Obsidian's docs: "stored in local storage,
 *     keyed to the specific vault". Outside the vault folder and outside
 *     data.json, desktop and mobile alike, so it is never synced or
 *     committed with the notes. It is not a system keyring and the plugin
 *     never calls it one. Nor does it depend on the backing: it feature-detects
 *     the two methods it uses and falls back to data.json, so minAppVersion
 *     stays where it was.
 *   - `SecretComponent` (a masked input bound to the store) is 1.11.1+ and
 *     is not used here: the settings tab keeps its own password inputs so
 *     the same rows work in both modes.
 *
 * The shape. `SecretVault` wraps the store (mode 'store') or nothing
 * (mode 'data-json'). The settings object on disk carries a secret ONLY in
 * data-json mode. In store mode `migrateSecrets` moves each one out on
 * load, blanks its field, and every consumer that needs a credential
 * receives `withSecrets(settings)`: a shallow copy with the fields and the
 * feed addresses filled back in. The connectors, the fetchers and
 * `sourceConfigured` stay pure and keep reading plain fields; they are
 * simply never handed the raw settings any more (gated by the test suite).

/* ========================================================================== *
 * Connector: Outlook through Microsoft Graph (2026-09-06), signed in with the
 * member's OWN Entra app registration. myICOR holds no developer account,
 * never sees a client id or a token; each member registers the app in their
 * own Microsoft account (docs/outlook-setup-guide.md) and pastes the
 * Application (client) ID here.
 *
 * The sign-in is the authorization code flow with PKCE (S256), a public
 * client, no secret. The redirect is the obsidian:// protocol handler,
 * registered in the Entra app as obsidian://icor-for-life-planner/auth under
 * "Mobile and desktop applications": the one redirect that works the same on
 * desktop and mobile, so the one path built. The device code flow is the
 * fallback for a device where that path is closed by policy; there is no
 * loopback listener (it would cover desktop only, which the scheme already
 * covers, at the price of a second auth path to keep).
 *
 * Every call to Microsoft goes through Obsidian's requestUrl, never the
 * renderer's fetch: fetch carries Origin: app://obsidian.md, and Entra then
 * treats the token call as a browser (SPA) request and refuses it
 * (AADSTS9002326). requestUrl is a native request with no Origin.
 *
 * Scopes are incremental. The first sign-in asks for
 *   offline_access openid profile Mail.Read Calendars.Read
 * and Mail.ReadWrite joins only when Complete on source is switched on: the
 * one write this connector ever makes (a flag status) is the one that earns
 * the write-capable permission, and a member who never turns the toggle on
 * never sees one on their consent screen.
 *
 * Tokens go through the secret vault and nowhere else. The refresh token
 * rotates on every use, so whatever comes back is stored over the old one;
 * an absent refresh_token in a response leaves the stored one untouched.

/* ---- self-write suppression (0.14.3) ------------------------------------
 * Obsidian's metadataCache `changed` event says that a file changed and
 * never who changed it. A sync run writes the SOURCE's own truth into a
 * note (`status: done` from reconcile, the pulled fields from
 * updateItemFile), the event fires on that write, and the push check then
 * reads the plugin's own hand as a local edit and sends it back out. That
 * is the whole of PM-12518: reconcile wrote `status: done`, the push check
 * saw a note that looked unchecked against a shadow that said done, and
 * PUT the list's first open status to ClickUp 1.1 seconds later.
 *
 * So every sync-run write stamps its path, and the push check ignores an
 * event for a stamped path inside the window. It is deliberately NOT a
 * blanket mute: a card action (a check, a plan move) is the person acting
 * and stamps nothing, and toggleDoneLocal clears any stamp on its path, so
 * a check one tick after a sync write still pushes at once.
 *
 * The signal is the FILE's own mtime, not a clock window (0.15.1, Flint's
 * Q1). `processFrontMatter` and `vault.process` both resolve after the
 * adapter has reconciled the index, so the live `TFile.stat.mtime` right
 * after the await IS the mtime of the write that just landed. Record it; in
 * the handler, a file still carrying that exact mtime is one nobody else has
 * touched, and anything else is somebody's edit.
 *
 * A window had to guess how late the `changed` event might be, and the cache
 * indexes from a queue: a large startup index, an Obsidian Sync burst or an
 * iOS suspend can push the event past any window, while a hand edit typed
 * inside the window was deferred to the next sync for nothing. The mtime
 * answers both without a clock.
 *
 * It is not load-bearing either way. If an adapter ever updated the stat
 * after the write resolved, the stamp would simply read as "not ours" and
 * the push check would run, where the note and the shadow already agree
 * after every sync write and a reopen needs the explicit flag. The signal
 * saves work; the invariant is carried by the other two layers.

 * Deleted at the source (0.15.0)
 *
 * Tom's rule: the planner notes are a MIRROR of the connected sources. A task
 * deleted there is deleted here. Until now absence from the open fetch meant
 * one thing, "completed", so a deleted task stayed in the vault as a card
 * that answered 404 to every write and said so in a toast on every sync.
 *
 * Absence cannot tell the two apart, so the plugin asks: one GET per absent
 * id that is not already done. Three hard limits on that question, because
 * it is the only place the plugin spends requests it did not have to:
 *
 *   - bounded per sync (GONE_PROBE_MAX_PER_SYNC). An absent task past the
 *     budget is NOT asked about and takes the completion path: its note is
 *     marked done, exactly as before this release, and it is never probed
 *     again, because a note that is done is no longer absent-and-open and
 *     so never enters a later batch. A vault with more than 25 tasks
 *     vanishing from one source in one pass therefore mirrors the deletion
 *     of the first 25 and reads the rest as completed.
 *   - asked once per id per sync, never per call site.
 *   - POSITIVE EVIDENCE ONLY. A probe that fails, times out, is refused or
 *     is not implemented for a connector reads as "still there". Marking a
 *     task done writes nothing anywhere and is one click to undo; moving a
 *     note to the trash is not, so a note is never trashed on a guess.

 * Routines (2026-09-04)
 *
 * A routine is a recurring block of steps that takes a place in the day:
 * from-to, one of three types (morning, afternoon, evening), on chosen
 * weekdays. It is not a task (never in the tray, never dragged, never synced
 * anywhere) and not a habit (a habit is one yes or no per day). It renders
 * in the lane as a time block whose steps check off one by one.
 *
 * One note per routine under <planner folder>/Routines/. The frontmatter is
 * the definition, the "## Steps" checklist is the list of steps (its boxes
 * are labels only, never state), and the "## Log" table under the
 * routine-log sentinel is the record: one row per day that had any
 * interaction, absence meaning nothing happened. Steps are identified by
 * position; editing the list mid-day changes that day's mapping, and the row
 * keeps the count that history needs.
 *
 * Nothing in sync touches a routine: itemFromFrontmatter refuses the type,
 * so collectItems, reconcile and the push path never see one.

 * renamed, paused, archived and deleted from the HABITS tab, its cadence
 * switched there (daily, weekdays, weekly on chosen days, monthly on a day
 * of the month). The My Life Habits room is not read for the board any
 * more: a note there is imported once (its schedule fields and its log
 * table move into the planner note, a pointer line stays in its place) and
 * the planner note keeps `linked_note` pointing back, so the meaning of the
 * habit stays where the person and the AI team write about it.
 *
 * The check-in is a body table under the habit-log sentinel (schema=streak:
 * date, marker, note; schema=process: date, marker, trigger), newest on
 * top, streaks computed and never stored. A check-in never writes
 * frontmatter. Every frontmatter write of the tab goes through
 * processFrontMatter, touches the field it is for and nothing else, and is
 * refused for a path outside <planner folder>/Habits/ before any file is
 * looked up.

/* ========================================================================== *
 * Weeks (2026-09-15)
 *
 * One note per ISO week at <planner folder>/Weeks/YYYY-Www.md, `type:
 * planner-week`, with two sentinel blocks in the body. It answers the two
 * questions nothing in the vault could answer before: what am I trying to
 * achieve this week, and what is the one thing that would make today a win.
 *
 * The two words, ruled 2026-09-15:
 *
 *   Weekly priority - one line in this week's note, an outcome with a done
 *                     state. Heading "## Weekly priorities", sentinel
 *                     weekly-priorities.
 *   Daily highlight - one sentence per day, chosen in the morning and
 *                     confirmed in the evening. Heading "## Daily
 *                     highlights", sentinel daily-highlights.
 *
 * Neither is a Goal. A Goal is the note in My Life, and that word stays
 * there. The starred planner item is neither either: it is a task PINNED to
 * the week, and its frontmatter key (`weekly_goal`) is unchanged because a
 * key a plugin has already written under is a migration and a label is not.
 *
 * What the plugin may write in this note: the two sentinel blocks, and the
 * `week` field when the note is created. Nothing else. Everything a person
 * typed around the blocks comes back byte for byte, which is what
 * upsertLogRow and toggleChecklistItem are built for. The note may equally
 * be edited by hand or by the vault's own planner-week.py; the parser reads
 * the shape, never who wrote it.
